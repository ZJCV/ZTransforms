## Background

[PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) provides an official data enhancement implementationï¼š[transforms](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/master/torchvision/transforms)ã€‚The module performs data enhancement operation based on PIL, and its advantages and disadvantages are as follows:

* Advantages:
  1.  Simple and clear data architecture
  2.  Simple and understandable data processing flow
  3. Perfect documentation introduction
* Disadvantages:
  1.  Based on the PIL backend, the provided image enhancement function is limited
  2.  Compared with other implementations, the execution speed is not fast
 
`torchvision` is also aware of this and has made improvements since "0.8.0"

```
Prior to v0.8.0, transforms in torchvision have traditionally been PIL-centric and presented multiple limitations due to that. Now, since v0.8.0, transforms implementations are Tensor and PIL compatible and we can achieve the following new features:

transform multi-band torch tensor images (with more than 3-4 channels)
torchscript transforms together with your model for deployment
support for GPU acceleration
batched transformation such as for videos
read and decode data directly as torch tensor with torchscript support (for PNG and JPEG image formats)
```

* On the one hand, the new backend [Pill-SIMD](https://github.com/uploadcare/Pill-SIMD) is used to improve the execution speed of PIL;
* On the other hand, PyTorch backend is added to realize GPU acceleration

Two data enhancement libraries are found on the Internet, which provide detection/segmentation data enhancement in addition to classification data enhancement:

* [imgaug](https://github.com/aleju/imgaug)ï¼šWhich realizes more data enhancement operationsï¼›
* [albumentations](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations/tree/f2462be3a4d01c872474d0e7fc0f32f387b06340)ï¼šIt finds out the fastest enhancement function in different backend (`pytorch/imgaug/opencv`) (refer to [benchmarking results](https://github.com/Albumentations-team/Albumentations#benchmarking-results))

The above two data enhancement libraries have realized the data flow operation mode similar to `transforms`ã€‚However, relatively speaking, I still like the official implementation and usage. Therefore, this code base is newly built, based on [transforms](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/master/torchvision/transforms), the `albumentation` backend implementation is added to the original functions, and new data enhancement operations are also added (if `albumentation` is not implemented, use `imgaug/opencv/...` to implement it).

## Install

```
$ pip install ztransforms
```

## Usage

```
# import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import ztransforms.cls as transforms
...
...
```
